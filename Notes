OOP - Object Oriented Programming
OOP - Object Oriented Programming is methodlogy or paradigm to design software based on object and classes
OOP - Simplifies software development by providing some concepts in as follow:
    - Object
    - classes
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphisn
    - Abstraction
    - Encapsulation

Object - A real world entity i.e. chair, table,pen,watch,computer etc
Class - is a group of objects which has similar property
      - is a logical entity
      - Data Members: variable
      - Methods - Method
Java is Typed language




Java Variables:
 - Local
 - Instance
 - Static

String In Java:
 Memory Based Analysis
 - Static (Stack)
   - When program is compiled memory is allocated
   - stack object can run very fast

 - Dynamic (RAM) (Heap)
  - memory allocation happens at run time
  - Accessing the object in heap takes more time
How to define String in Java?
 By Using String Literal
 By Using New Keyword

 Methods in String:

OOPS: Object Oriented Programmings

Pillars of OOPS Based on below criteria:
   1. Code re-usability
     a. Inheritance
       How to adopt inheritance in Java
         Using extends keyword
     b. Polymorphism

  2. Security
     a. Abstraction
     b. Encapsulation

Polymorphism:
Multiple Form
How to achieve Polymorphism in Java?
 1. Method Overloading
     a. Define a method for Method Overloadin
     b. By changing number of arguments
     c. By Changing the data type of the arguments

 2. Method Overriding
